## What is a Web Framework?

A web framework is a software framework designed to aid the development of web applications, providing a structured foundation for building and managing web-related tasks. It simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and maintaining web applications.

## How to Build a Web Framework with Flask

Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python. To build a web framework with Flask, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:**
   Install Flask using the command: `pip install Flask`.

2. **Creating a Flask App:**
   Start by creating a Flask application with a basic structure.

3. **Defining Routes in Flask:**
   Routes define the paths at which different parts of your application can be accessed. They are associated with functions that handle requests to those paths.

4. **What is a Route?**
   A route is a URL pattern associated with a specific function in your Flask application. It defines how your application responds to different requests.

5. **Handling Variables in a Route:**
   You can include variables in routes to make them dynamic. These variables are passed to the associated function for further processing.

6. **What is a Template?**
   A template is a file that contains the structure of an HTML page with placeholders for dynamic content. Flask uses the Jinja templating engine for this purpose.

7. **Creating an HTML Response in Flask by Using a Template:**
   Render HTML pages dynamically by using templates. Flask's `render_template` function facilitates this process.

8. **Creating a Dynamic Template (Loops, Conditions...):**
   Enhance your templates by incorporating loops and conditions. This allows you to create dynamic and responsive web pages.

9. **Displaying Data from a MySQL Database in HTML:**
   Connect Flask to a MySQL database and retrieve data to display in your HTML templates. Utilize Flask-SQLAlchemy for seamless integration.
